### Structure of the repository & Contributing
- Documentation is grouped by folders 
- In general, create a folder with the topic of what you're writing about and put a README.md in that folder with your prose. That way it takes fewer clicks to find the relevant information. Also, place the topic folder in an existing folder if necessary.
- Update the table of contents to reflect your changes to the repository. Fix any outdated ToC links if you find some.
