For any project with a large dataset, it can be useful to create an interactive dashboard for users to engage and make sense of project data.  A dashboard offers multiple visualizations with ways to sort and filter the data simulatiously. There are many solutions available to create a dashboard.  Our current favorite is called [Dash](https://dash.plot.ly/), which offers a relatively easy way to define the layout and callbacks for a React.js app using Python. The layout determines what elements appear on the page, such as buttons, graphs and datatables.  A callback defines how each element is updated.   Dash apps can be added to Django projects with the [django-plotly-dash app](https://github.com/GibbsConsulting/django-plotly-dash). 

This tutorial will detail some of the basics for creating a Dash app and deploying it to an exiting Django project. 
This will serve as a suppliment to the [Dash documentation](https://dash.plot.ly/) and our existing dash-related repositories, such as Fiona and Shufan's [dashboard](https://github.com/HCDigitalScholarship/dashboard).
