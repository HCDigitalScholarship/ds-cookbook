# Working with data Django-to-Mapbox
This document explains how to pull data from a django model into a Mapbox layer. In short, you will use a python template in the views.py file to create a mapbox FeatureCollection of geo-JSON data. 

End goal: give mapbox a javascript list of several data points in the proper geoJSON format, also in accordance with Mapbox's FeatureCollection data category:
``` 
"coordinates" : [latitude, longitude]},
"properties" : { "NameOfProperty1" : "Value1", "NameOfProperty2" : "Value2"} 
```
and so forth. We must serialize data from the relevant django model such that we have all information in this exact format of curly braces, quotation marks, colons, and commas that Mapbox requires.	    

(Aside: newer versions of django have a built-in geoJSON serializer which was ridiculously/surprisingly difficult to install. Stop reading if you can figure that out tho!)

## Step 1: Write a helper function in views.py to properly serialize data from the model you're working with.
In views.py, define a helper function. It might be something like:
```
def mapData_ToGeoJSON():
``` 
Within this function, make a python template. [This stack overflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4288973/whats-the-difference-between-s-and-d-in-python-string-formatting) may help, but essentially you are creating a string in the proper format of any single data point, except that rather than including actual data, use placeholders for values (%d for string, %s for integers, etc). In other words, include every variable you want to have d3 ultimately work with in proper JSON format with a placeholder for each variable's value.
 
To do so, declare a variable template and assign it, as below, to the general format that d3 requires. In the case of the QMH project example, a d3 stacked bar graph shows tallies of hospital patients by year, broken down into their religious affiliations. So, the template for this looks like:
```
def mapData_ToGeoJSON():

template = \
	    ''' \
	    {"type" : "Feature",
	        "geometry" : {
	        "type" : "Point",
	        "coordinates" : [%s,%s]},
	    "properties" : { "Name" : "%s", "Year" : "%s", "Count": "%s"}
	    },
	'''
```
Copy and past the variable template declaration, replacing each of the data field names ("Name", "Year", and "Count" in this example) with those which match the data fields of the Django model you're working with, preserving the double quotation marks, and changing the letter after each % to match the type of the expected value. <strong> It is important to keep the leading \ and opening/closing ''' (triple-single-quotes) so Mapbox can read everything properly </strong>.

Note the level of precision here: variable names in quotes, spaces after each colon, <strong> AND a comma following the close curly brace </strong> to accommodate another data point to follow it. 
  
 ## Step 2: Accumulate all data, properly-formatted. Loop through data in the model, fitting it into the template each time.
 Now, we want to effectively grab all of our data from Django, force it through the template one data point at a time, and collect up all of the properly-formatted data into a big list. 
 
 First, declare the variable output as:
 ```
 # the head of the geojson file
	output = \
	    ''' \
	
	    '''
```
Copy-paste this code exactly. The funky quotes/backslashes sets up the header of the file properly. Ultimately, output is what this mapData_ToGeoJSON() function will return.

Next, declare an empty list called something like rawData. We'll use this to hold onto all the information we first grab from django before we can format it. Then, grab your data from your django model using a loop! Write a for loop which works ```for``` element ```in``` NAME_OF_DJANGO_MODEL```.objects.all()``` and append, as its own list, to rawData. For example, the QMH map version of this looks like:
```
rawData = []
	for e in PlaceToMap.objects.all():
		rawData.append([e.latitude, e.longitude, e.Name, e.Year, e.Count])
```
Here, PlaceToMap is the name of the model, and latitude, longitute, Name, Year, and Count are the names of the data fields. This is the django way to talk about a model's data points and data fields in views.py!

At this point, rawData is a list of lists, where each sublist is a comma-separated list of data fields for each particular data point. 
Now, we want to force all of this raw data, one point at a time, through the template we made and accumulate it into a variable to return. 
The code for this step from the maps example looks like:
```
for row in rawData:
	lat = row[0]
	lon = row[1]
	name = row[2]
	pop = row[3]
	output += template % (row[0], (row[1]), row[2], row[3], row[4])
```
In short, for each element of rawData, shove that data into the template and then accumulate into the output variable, which we'll return in the next step. One trick to this whole process is to remember the order in which you are pulling and placing each field's values; we know the value corresponding to latitute comes first since we append it to rawData first, etc. Be careful to not mix up data values! That's why variables lat, lon, name, and pop are declared even though we don't end up actually using them :). 

Simply modify this for loop to fit your data, keeping in mind that the 0th item of each sublist in rawData corresponds to the first data field, the 1st to the second, etc. 

## Step 3: Returning the formatted data
Now that we have all of our data in the proper templated format all together in the variable ```output```, the last lines of this function should be:
```
output += \
	    ''' \
	    ]
	}
	    '''
	return(output)
```
After we put all of the templated data into output, this adds the close braces and brackets we need to complete the picky geoJSON format.


Now, all that's left is that we have to put this output in the right place to hand to the template where our d3 visualization is waiting for a data source.

Somewhere else in views.py, you should have a function which renders each template. An example: The ```causes``` function below, for example, simply enables the FriendsVIS.html template to be loaded when users request the page marked "causes". There should be several similar functions just like this in views.py, so all your templates can be loaded! 
```
def causes(request):
	return render(request, 'FriendsVIS.html')
```

In whichever rendering function is relevant to the data/template you're using, declare some variable to hold the result of the formatting function we just wrote. This function should return a rendering of the proper template, plus some funny django business:

```
def some_relevant_name(request):
	places_list = mapData_toGEOJSON()
	return render(request, 'QMHMap.html', {'places': places_list})
```

The above code creates a variable with the formatted data, places_list, and says that when the QMHMAP.html page is loaded, django will know to pass the places_list data and will call it places. 

You can call these things whatever you want, but the curly braces, single quotes, and colon are important! 


## Hook up all your work in views.py to the Mapbox code in your template.
When you create a mapbox map in your .HTML file, you must set the map source variable to be the data we've just organized from django.

Under the declaration for ``` var map = new mapboxgl.Map({ //....}); ``` and within (and towards the top of) the ```map.on('load', function(){ ``` Follow the below format:
```
     map.addSource("django-data", {
            "type": "geojson",
            "data": { "type" : "FeatureCollection",
            "features" : [{{places|safe}}, 
        }) //If this extra parenthese goes away, the whole map breaks. It looks like it's extra, but it closes the GeoJSON format. 
```
Here, our data is a FeatureCollection where each feature can be found in a list of the templated data we made in views.py 

Pretty much everthing above you should copy and paste into the top of your 'on load' function, just making sure to change the information after ```"features" : ``` to match your work in views.py. Note that in the code above, places is the name we gave when we called ``` return render(request, #...) ``` in the view for the page in the previous step, just without the single quotes. 

Also heed the comment about the extra parentheses! At least in Alison's text editor, this close parenthese is highlighted as if it's a problem, but if you delete it, the whole map breaks...

The ```|safe``` bit is what Django calls a filter. It is included immediately after as a way to ensure the data is handed to d3 in the correct format; without it, sometimes d3 is handed some weird  version of the data (extra characters like &lt, &#39, &amp, all over the place!) which is of course NOT the form d3 needs to handle it. [Check out this link](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/templates/) and scroll to the "Automatic HTML Escaping" section for details. 

It's also important that we have the list ([ ]) around ```{{places|safe}}```â€”all of the features must be as a list. 

In summary, you've taken each data entry from django, fitted it into the applicable GeoJSON format, given the formatted data a name to talk about upon the relevant template's load, then told Mapbox to populate the map with a FeatureCollection of the information we're calling by that same name. But all of this has been just to establish the django data as a distinct (properly-formatted) data source. next, we have to add it to a layer!

##Add Data to a Layer


## Note:
If you take a look at the ReligionDiversityData_toJSON() and TotalReligionDiversityData_toJSON() functions in the QMH project's views.py, you'll see that this process is not so simple. That's because, unlike with the map data, the data for the religious diversity feature had not been tallied. Basically, after I had the initial loop ```for e in ReligiousDiversityData.objects.all```, I then used some extra accumulators and lists etc. to tally up data by year and religion. This extra wrinkle is tedious but allows for new data to be entered easily; a new discovery of a non-quaker patient need not affect the value of any stored total/tally, since django does all the tallying itself after data entry.
